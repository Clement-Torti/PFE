## Best practices
The code should also not exceed 75 lines for each function.
The code should not exceed the limit of 400 lines per file.
There should be an empty line between imports and modules.
Variables with constant values should be declared with ‘const.’
Leverage ng-bind In Place Of {{}}
Single Responsibility Principle. It is important to not create more than one instance of any component, directive, or service within a single file.
Use Directive For DOM Handling
Split Large Components Into Smaller Sizes. They can be broken down to a point where each component features no more than one atomic task.
Make Use Of Angular CLI
Controller As Syntax
Use Common HTTP Service
